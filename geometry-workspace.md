### 2024-04-07 14:45 - conversation with andy

yesterday, I interrupted my thoughts on the eclipse to send an email to andy (baker). we're talking about geometry, and so while it's a bit cumbersome to include the whole conversation, I'll include the relevant geometry parts here, because they're interesting... his energy is quite different from yours, but for whatever reason I decided to skip over to emailing him, instead of emailing you, so it's mixed now. I'm going to mix it even further -- by putting this in here (sorry I'm so destructive). I know you like geometry and stuff, so hopefully it'll work out (it probably won't).

anyway, the cube to dodecahedron transformation is actually not a difficult one once you know what to look for. I first heard about it from frank chester (though I don't remember him saying how to do it). anyway, I've figured out how to do it:
1. to construct a dodecahedron, we're going to lay down one pentagon right next to another (so their edges touch). then we're going to bend them at the edge until the V on either side of the joined edge is at the angle of one of the pentagram points (144(degrees)) -- and that's where we're going to insert the third pentagram.
2. the angle and shape where these three pentagrams come together will now form the point (divide a circle into 3 and bend the edges back so they form a 3-sided pyramid). there are 4 of these points to a dodecahedron, (so keep these points in mind, because that's what we're going to be making).
3. now, take the cube and select any 4 parallel edges of your desire, and what we're going to do is split the vertex at the end of each of these edges into three (the 3-sided pyramid). the edges that come out of that vertex from the 3 split will each have the exact same angle as the V where we inserted the third pentagram... now, push the edges of the cube in further, such that the lines from the 3-sided pyramid are all going to have the unit length of the side of the pentagram, and you should be looking at a dodecahedron.

the reason why this transformation of "pushing the edges" is so important, is (for a number of reasons), but these are the ones that come to me now:
1. you'll notice that 4 parallel edges being pushed splits 8 vertices (producing 24 new edges).
2. those 8 vertices are interesting because they feel kinda feel similar to the difference between a cube and an octahedron.
	- each vertex for a cube travels 1/2 of a unit away from the centre along all all there of the axises -- and then the lines that are formed between each of those verticies are all of unit length. this is where root-3 (which passes through the centre) comes from. for the octahedron, each vertex extends out of the centre and travels only along one axis. therefore we can think of the root-3 diagonal as being formed from traveling out from the centre in 3 full units of direction (3 half units one way and 3 the opposite way). now

[I have to pause because I keep losing the image and can't maintain it. trying to do these sorts of things under different energetic conditions is a bit of a challenge for me.

1. I'm writing this during the day, and all of the other messages were at night (it makes a difference)
2. I don't jive with his energy really at all, so nothing really flows. I don't mind though because it's just another evolution-of-desire -- *and* it'll make me better at being able to hold a feeling even when I'm reflecting a person with energy that doesn't jive (improvements over the long run)
3. I've got to keep aborting stuff (no-manifestation) and I don't mind with geometry, because I really enjoy it, but it is awfully symbolic, and so besides the beauty which is hidden underneith all the symbol, I don't mind aborting it all with someone that has chaotic energy.
4. I watched veritassium's video on 37, and according to him, I should reject 37% of the offers that come through (andy was the first), and then pick the next best one that's better than all the previous one -- but I'm not going for best -- I'm going for "worst" -- lol, so I guess this is what I'm going with.
	- same thing with his video on game theory: while the best performing strategy (in the long run) is to go "tit-for-tat" -- I have a difficult time doing that. it may be a "winning" strategy, but for me it doesn't feel good. instead, I have to go with the "worst" strategy, which is always try and cooperate, even if the other side is not cooperative. andy is cooperative, so this is a new game now, not of winning points, but of learning to be a better foil (reflecting the positive attributes of someone even when I don't jive with them).
	- come to think of it, this is ultimately a game of selfishness, and ... OH ... I just got my answer. OK, I see it now. I'll just do the "take the stuff I like, and leave everything else" technique. interesting. I wonder if this can be converted into another game (it's kinda hard to make feeling symbolic, but I'll try).

so now I'm gonna lay on the ground and see if I can figure out how to stabilise the image]
