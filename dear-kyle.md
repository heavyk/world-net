### 2024-03-23 15:51 - stone masonry and beyond

last night I launched off into a discussion with jaron, and there was an interesting dynamic to it because he was standing at the top of the stairs, and I at the bottom. that's interesting because I'm usually above him or the same height as him if I'm seated (he sits in a wheelchair) while we talk. the other interesting thing about it, is numerous times while stoned (which makes me significantly more sensitive to energy), standing at the top of the stairs like that is a kinda trippy experience. I often times like to just stand at the top of the stairs there and let my mind wander a bit.
our discussion started out talking about jews and how spain used to be sorta like the wild west before they got kicked out of spain by isabella and ferdinand (17:09 - paused for a few hours(wtf?) to read wikipedia about). from there, we started talking about these different sacred sites, and my ideas on them. we talked about tibet, jerusalem, giza, and stuff like that -- cause I was telling him that the physical attributes of the place, everyone can see cause it's just a bunch of rocks, but there's a parallel reality there that isn't normally visible. I explained how certain genetics come with accses to those astral zones pre-installed, but also it's possible to gain access to it without having been initiated. I did precisely that a while back when I was in spain, and the consequences of it are the life that I'm presently living. tesla also figured it out, I'm pretty sure.
while talking about the how these sites work, I was explaining to him that these sites are all centred around a node where energy comes out -- and when I say "energy", I mean hydrogen, not electricity -- which you may want to notice that it's this energy that powers the cells in the body and through the mitochondria, produces ATP. it's cOmpletely transparent, but it can be felt, and even can have a sort of wind feel to it (prolly something like "ion wind"). so, to explain to him about how this parallel reality is able to exist in the same space as the physical reality, I was explaining that there are all kinds of vibrations in the same space, and so to look at it, it would just look like a chaotic wind or vortex (I think of it flat/digitally like fuzz/noise seen on a television set when no signal is being received), and so because it's just a bunch of seemingly random fluctuations, the brain just filters it out because it's irrelevant data (our brains filter for more signal and less noise). however, once the key which transforms those random fluctuations into something coherent is given to the person (ie, the initiation ritual), they're now able to see a whole new reality inside of the u-dimension (ie, the standing-waves present in the fluctuations). I explained that these realities all live in the same place, but one needs the key to make sense of them -- but, it's possible to find the key using a logical and rational process (I'll explain some of it later).
from there, I started to talk to jaron about these different keys, cause I was trying to explain how they worked to him. I started to go down the route of explaining resonant chambers and things like that, but he doesn't really understand that right now, so I skipped it. instead, the way I explained it to him was by saying that these energetic nodes are streaming out energy, and so the building that's placed on top of the node contains the energy, cause it bounces around inside of the building, and so therefore the building can be thought of as the key.
	it's pretty easy to see how (like a drum) the wavelength of the different resonant chambers in the building are shaping the vibration into wavelengths of that length (very much like the great pyramid and cathedrals do)
anyway, that conversation got me thinking, because we also talked about how in medieval times they went down to look at the temple in jerusalem, and whatever they go from there somehow allowed them to build all these cathedrals around europe. I was strongly reminded of you guys, and remembered the "shamir" episode -- but then, while talking to him, I realised that the shamir isn't actually a real thing -- cause when I looked into it a long time ago (a few repositories back), I noticed that the samir was not really a physical thing, but actually a *concept*. I told him, that I found it pretty unlikely that there actually was anything under the temple, as it'd likely been quite looted and every physical thing taken out. it seemed to me that what they found was probably an empty resonant chamber -- and it was the mesurements of that resonant chamber which is the "shamir".
	another interesting thing happened to me lately, which is of note: I [wrote about it in question-aire](../shake-sphere/question-aire.md#2024-03-19-2136---why-do-i-think-im-on-pluto) when I talked about pluto -- and essentially what happened, is that I pumped up energy really high by staring into the sun with my left eye, which (cause of my situation), that energy passes through my left-hemisphere (if I had've looked through my right eye, chaos would have ensued) for about 5-10m or so (don't remember how long, because I lose track of reality when that much energy is passing through me). anyway, when I do that, it allows a lot of the solar energy/hydrogen to pass through me a lot of energy, and during that time, paul was able to energetically take down a tree and stuff. I realised that the way that these guys are performing work is the same way that these cathedrals were built: after pumping up the energy (they probably used gay sex and performed work under higher energy lunar/planetary alignments), they visualise the thing, and then it would come into being into physical (the pyramids were probably built using levitation and energetic saws -- a different technology than the one herod used to build the temple).
		when solar energy (chi) passes through, it's a very different energy than for example earth energy coming up out of the ground and collecting on peaks (like lighting rods, mountains, or cathedrals). for example, the great pyramid is all about the merging of earth/prana energies coming out of the ground, and the solar energy coming from the sun -- so when I lay on the ground, and look into the sun, I'm kinda doing the same thing as one of these cathedrals. me, and my skull become the resonant chamber, and same thing-- the energy disperses through the ground and produces a sort of bubble or aura around where I did it for a while (even snow has a hard time sticking for a while in places where I've star-watched for a bit). essentially, I become a mobile version of one of these nodes that these cathedrals are built on.
	after that experience, I thought about you guys and randall, and I seriously considered sending you guys another email (of which I expected no response, obviously) asking if you guys wanted to come to pueblo and build a temple out in the field near to my house. I can provide the energy, and someone needs to do the architecting work of figuring out the dimensions, and then my energy will allow the visualisation to become a real temple.
I'd like to talk now about dimensions, because each one of these astral system has their own dimensions (ie, tibet, giza, antartica, and jerusalem all have different dimensions), and so what the cathedral builders did was to essentially extend the 2nd-ray installation of jerusalem out to cover quite a bit of europe and then later a lot of central and south america. I can't be certain, but I would imagine that the temple in salt lake might also be a little bit different as well. we can think of each of these installations as being distinct, because they control perception.
	to understand the concept of perception, consider that females are really strongly adherent to this kind of energy, so notice their behaviour: during the day, solar energy is stronger, and so the chi is shaped to have the space of the cathedrals -- and during the day the girls have chastity and they're proper maids; however, when the sun goes down, that chi energy is starting to wane (it's reflective of our thoughts and emotions), and so now the only energy that's being shaped by these cathedrals is earth energy. the difference between earth energy and solar energy is largely symbolic. earth is much higher frequency, and so can be thought of like pure-desire (sometimes it gets down into x-ray frequencies, but most of it is far beyond our capacity to measure right now) -- and so the astral installation is not going to be carrying nearly as much of the symbolic stuff that the church and cathedral builders have put into it, and so the rules sorta become relaxed a lot during the night -- which is why nightclubs can only really function well at night, and sex during the day is very very strange and warlike in its feeling.
when designing another 2nd-ray installation, dimensions are going to be important, because no frequency ever lives by itself. even if you could make a set of dimensions that was 100% dissonant to every other 2nd-ray installation, all interactions of frequencies make higher harmonics, and those will combine with the higher harmonics of others -- which is why even "satanism" and the taboo/dissonant to the church's symbolic system, *still* has resonances with more abstract cOncepts. those dimensions can even be designed to be resonant with other installations (ie, I want it to resonate symbolically with tibet, but be as dissonant as possible with antarctica). I'm actually going to stop writing now. bye!

#### 2024-03-23 21:28 - how is the shamir a concept?

well, the way I've worked it out goes something like this: when herod built the temple, he had the ability to soften stone and to manipulate it as if it were like clay(?) -- well, now imagine to yourself that you're building all of the temple and stuff -- it's just not practical for one person to do all of the things -- or maybe others asked him how to do it, or maybe it was his own symbolic invocation of the concept (not really sure which one) -- and so inside of the 2nd-ray installation, there needs to be a symbolic way of accessing this very high frequency concept. (brb, need water)
