### 2024-03-23 15:51 - stone masonry and beyond

last night I launched off into a discussion with jaron, and there was an interesting dynamic to it because he was standing at the top of the stairs, and I at the bottom. that's interesting because I'm usually above him or the same height as him if I'm seated (he sits in a wheelchair) while we talk. the other interesting thing about it, is numerous times while stoned (which makes me significantly more sensitive to energy), standing at the top of the stairs like that is a kinda trippy experience. I often times like to just stand at the top of the stairs there and let my mind wander a bit.
our discussion started out talking about jews and how spain used to be sorta like the wild west before they got kicked out of spain by isabella and ferdinand (17:09 - paused for a few hours(wtf?) to read wikipedia about). from there, we started talking about these different sacred sites, and my ideas on them. we talked about tibet, jerusalem, giza, and stuff like that -- cause I was telling him that the physical attributes of the place, everyone can see cause it's just a bunch of rocks, but there's a parallel reality there that isn't normally visible. I explained how certain genetics come with accses to those astral zones pre-installed, but also it's possible to gain access to it without having been initiated. I did precisely that a while back when I was in spain, and the consequences of it are the life that I'm presently living. tesla also figured it out, I'm pretty sure.
while talking about the how these sites work, I was explaining to him that these sites are all centred around a node where energy comes out -- and when I say "energy", I mean hydrogen, not electricity -- which you may want to notice that it's this energy that powers the cells in the body and through the mitochondria, produces ATP. it's cOmpletely transparent, but it can be felt, and even can have a sort of wind feel to it (prolly something like "ion wind"). so, to explain to him about how this parallel reality is able to exist in the same space as the physical reality, I was explaining that there are all kinds of vibrations in the same space, and so to look at it, it would just look like a chaotic wind or vortex (I think of it flat/digitally like fuzz/noise seen on a television set when no signal is being received), and so because it's just a bunch of seemingly random fluctuations, the brain just filters it out because it's irrelevant data (our brains filter for more signal and less noise). however, once the key which transforms those random fluctuations into something coherent is given to the person (ie, the initiation ritual), they're now able to see a whole new reality inside of the u-dimension (ie, the standing-waves present in the fluctuations). I explained that these realities all live in the same place, but one needs the key to make sense of them -- but, it's possible to find the key using a logical and rational process (I'll explain some of it later).
from there, I started to talk to jaron about these different keys, cause I was trying to explain how they worked to him. I started to go down the route of explaining resonant chambers and things like that, but he doesn't really understand that right now, so I skipped it. instead, the way I explained it to him was by saying that these energetic nodes are streaming out energy, and so the building that's placed on top of the node contains the energy, cause it bounces around inside of the building, and so therefore the building can be thought of as the key.
	it's pretty easy to see how (like a drum) the wavelength of the different resonant chambers in the building are shaping the vibration into wavelengths of that length (very much like the great pyramid and cathedrals do)
anyway, that conversation got me thinking, because we also talked about how in medieval times they went down to look at the temple in jerusalem, and whatever they go from there somehow allowed them to build all these cathedrals around europe. I was strongly reminded of you guys, and remembered the "shamir" episode -- but then, while talking to him, I realised that the shamir isn't actually a real thing -- cause when I looked into it a long time ago (a few repositories back), I noticed that the samir was not really a physical thing, but actually a *concept*. I told him, that I found it pretty unlikely that there actually was anything under the temple, as it'd likely been quite looted and every physical thing taken out. it seemed to me that what they found was probably an empty resonant chamber -- and it was the mesurements of that resonant chamber which is the "shamir".
	another interesting thing happened to me lately, which is of note: I [wrote about it in question-aire](../shake-sphere/question-aire.md#2024-03-19-2136---why-do-i-think-im-on-pluto) when I talked about pluto -- and essentially what happened, is that I pumped up energy really high by staring into the sun with my left eye, which (cause of my situation), that energy passes through my left-hemisphere (if I had've looked through my right eye, chaos would have ensued) for about 5-10m or so (don't remember how long, because I lose track of reality when that much energy is passing through me). anyway, when I do that, it allows a lot of the solar energy/hydrogen to pass through me a lot of energy, and during that time, paul was able to energetically take down a tree and stuff. I realised that the way that these guys are performing work is the same way that these cathedrals were built: after pumping up the energy (they probably used gay sex and performed work under higher energy lunar/planetary alignments), they visualise the thing, and then it would come into being into physical (the pyramids were probably built using levitation and energetic saws -- a different technology than the one herod used to build the temple).
		when solar energy (chi) passes through, it's a very different energy than for example earth energy coming up out of the ground and collecting on peaks (like lighting rods, mountains, or cathedrals). for example, the great pyramid is all about the merging of earth/prana energies coming out of the ground, and the solar energy coming from the sun -- so when I lay on the ground, and look into the sun, I'm kinda doing the same thing as one of these cathedrals. me, and my skull become the resonant chamber, and same thing-- the energy disperses through the ground and produces a sort of bubble or aura around where I did it for a while (even snow has a hard time sticking for a while in places where I've star-watched for a bit). essentially, I become a mobile version of one of these nodes that these cathedrals are built on.
	after that experience, I thought about you guys and randall, and I seriously considered sending you guys another email (of which I expected no response, obviously) asking if you guys wanted to come to pueblo and build a temple out in the field near to my house. I can provide the energy, and someone needs to do the architecting work of figuring out the dimensions, and then my energy will allow the visualisation to become a real temple.
I'd like to talk now about dimensions, because each one of these astral system has their own dimensions (ie, tibet, giza, antartica, and jerusalem all have different dimensions), and so what the cathedral builders did was to essentially extend the 2nd-ray installation of jerusalem out to cover quite a bit of europe and then later a lot of central and south america. I can't be certain, but I would imagine that the temple in salt lake might also be a little bit different as well. we can think of each of these installations as being distinct, because they control perception.
	to understand the concept of perception, consider that females are really strongly adherent to this kind of energy, so notice their behaviour: during the day, solar energy is stronger, and so the chi is shaped to have the space of the cathedrals -- and during the day the girls have chastity and they're proper maids; however, when the sun goes down, that chi energy is starting to wane (it's reflective of our thoughts and emotions), and so now the only energy that's being shaped by these cathedrals is earth energy. the difference between earth energy and solar energy is largely symbolic. earth is much higher frequency, and so can be thought of like pure-desire (sometimes it gets down into x-ray frequencies, but most of it is far beyond our capacity to measure right now) -- and so the astral installation is not going to be carrying nearly as much of the symbolic stuff that the church and cathedral builders have put into it, and so the rules sorta become relaxed a lot during the night -- which is why nightclubs can only really function well at night, and sex during the day is very very strange and warlike in its feeling.
when designing another 2nd-ray installation, dimensions are going to be important, because no frequency ever lives by itself. even if you could make a set of dimensions that was 100% dissonant to every other 2nd-ray installation, all interactions of frequencies make higher harmonics, and those will combine with the higher harmonics of others -- which is why even "satanism" and the taboo/dissonant to the church's symbolic system, *still* has resonances with more abstract cOncepts. those dimensions can even be designed to be resonant with other installations (ie, I want it to resonate symbolically with tibet, but be as dissonant as possible with antarctica). I'm actually going to stop writing now. bye!

#### 2024-03-23 21:28 - how is the shamir a concept?

well, the way I've worked it out goes something like this: when herod built the temple, he had the ability to soften stone and to manipulate it as if it were like clay(?) -- well, now imagine to yourself that you're building all of the temple and stuff -- it's just not practical for one person to do all of the things -- or maybe others asked him how to do it, or maybe it was his own symbolic invocation of the concept (not really sure which one) -- and so inside of the 2nd-ray installation, there needs to be a symbolic way of accessing this very high frequency concept. (brb, need water - 21:35)
	to understand this, let's take the great pyramid as an example: if you go into the great pyramid and start to do your OMs or whatever to get your throat in resonance with the chamber, then you're going to start to *feel* like that chamber in your emotions/gut/stomach (throat is opposite stomach, just like pineal is opposite nuts). when that happens, you begin to resonate like that *conceptually*, which means that inside of the u-dimension, the symbolic stuff that is present in the pyramid relating to DNA and things like that are going to become visible to you (in the u-dimension).
		it's possible to get access to the u-dimension without needing to have gay sex (or some other initiatory procedure, which all of the ones I know of involve gay sex). the way I learned how to do it was to lower resistance for quite a while, then during an ayahuasca ceremony where there we were (36 of us? I can't remember how many people) swaying back and forward in 3 cOncentric hexagons, I started to notice the space between me and the other people. as I began to expand that space, everything began to sparkle, and all of the colours became more vivid, sight, taste, touch, and smell were all enhanced as well. I also felt as if I'm finally *inside* of my head, instead of just looking at a screen in my eyes. anyway, it's inside of that u-dimension where concepts can be conjured, and they will (like in a dream), appear as the symbolically most similar thing.
		a concept is just an emotion: for example, when someone asks me to perform a differential equation, I *feel* like I don't know it, and so therefore it's difficult to impossible for me to arrive to the answer; however, if someone asks me to add 3 and 5, I *feel* like that's an easy one, and so the answer appears to me (in the u-dimension) instantly (though for things like math equations, I often doubt my recognition of that concept cause I can't see it, so it takes me a second or two to recognise what I'm seeing -- or, to save time, I resort to just counting it off on my fingers or using a calculator). for people who can see the u-dimension (like tesla), the conceptual answer appears to them instantly, and they can just see the symbolic answer to whatever equation they feel like they can know the answer to. likewise, *any* concept can be cOnjured -- and they will appear just as I perceive them to be; I could conjure my mother, or a really hot girl in a red dress, or whatever I want, and if I could see the u-dimension, it would appear before me in the symbolic/picture form that closestly represents what I conjured.
	so, now let's take a look at this conceptually: a concept is something like an audio recording (and also an encrypted file), and so the higher fidelity my brain is running at, the better the quality of the concept that will appear to me. likewise, because the *key* to this concept is the resonating chamber, the more resonant I get with the chamber, the less noise or static on the recording. so, we can now imagine that there are different levels of perception of this concept. for example, if I were to conjure the shamir, for me it may appear as a bird or something like that, which is capable of performing the impossible. for another person, it may appear as a beaver or something, again capable of performing the impossible -- and these forms, let's just call them the "animal forms" -- not the thing exactly, but one angle of perception on it. now, when looking deeper into the form and gaining better reception/resonance with the higher frequency concept, now perhaps, it takes on a more of a personal understanding, where the concept isn't just a thing that does a thing, but now I get the *process* whereby it's able to perform the impossible (ie, some force/desire/fear is able to overcome the impossible) and so the shamir is reflective of a person that desires to do something impossible (like rebuild solomon's temple). now, let's say an even deeper and higher frequency aspect of the concept is, let's say a cosmic principle where the shamir is doing something that the earth itself is doing all of the time: providing a way for anyone to get what they want, and so it takes on a new meaning where I don't need to perform a symbolic *action*, process, or ceremony anymore to get what I want, but that it's already there. the only one that was blocking me from getting it was the belief that I had to perform some sequence of actions to do the thing; now everything is possible.
	all of those levels, and potentially more are encoded in the conept. I've only translated a few levels here, but the practitioner is the one that's now going to carry that concept out into the world. each person who enters the chamber views the concept from their angle of perception, and sees the image/concept with the clarity that they're capable of *receiving*.
the way that I believe the templars were able to access the shamir was probably through gay sex inside of the chamber. the reason why is because of the way gay sex works is more about alignment of the partners standing waves, more than the waves themselves. to explain: during ejaculation, the prostate spins the jizz in alignment with the cOncept that's present on the opposite end (brain/pineal) and so when sex is happening with a woman, the concepts are opposing one another (head-to-head like rams butting heads), but with gay sex, the prostates and penises are parallel to each other, so there isn't nearly as much conflict/alignment of the concepts themselves, but instead alignment of the standing waves. so, for the partners, they're not affecting the other person's concepts too much, and so therefore they find a whole lot more harmony between each other, and also the standing wave key is more easily retransmitted from one partner to another (ie, the initiation).
in that chamber, I believe what they "found" was not physical, but instead by aligning theirselve with the dimensions of that chamber, they were able to access the conceptual dimensions and the form of perception necessary (like the ability to see this prana/chi energy) along with other necessary/related things involved in the building of that temple. they then took those things (the 2nd-ray system installed by herod in jerusalem) and exported it to europe and portions of south/central america.
