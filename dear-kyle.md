### 2024-03-23 15:51 - stone masonry and beyond

last night I launched off into a discussion with jaron, and there was an interesting dynamic to it because he was standing at the top of the stairs, and I at the bottom. that's interesting because I'm usually above him or the same height as him if I'm seated (he sits in a wheelchair) while we talk. the other interesting thing about it, is numerous times while stoned (which makes me significantly more sensitive to energy), standing at the top of the stairs like that is a kinda trippy experience. I often times like to just stand at the top of the stairs there and let my mind wander a bit.
our discussion started out talking about jews and how spain used to be sorta like the wild west before they got kicked out of spain by isabella and ferdinand (17:09 - paused for a few hours(wtf?) to read wikipedia about). from there, we started talking about these different sacred sites, and my ideas on them. we talked about tibet, jerusalem, giza, and stuff like that -- cause I was telling him that the physical attributes of the place, everyone can see cause it's just a bunch of rocks, but there's a parallel reality there that isn't normally visible. I explained how certain genetics come with accses to those astral zones pre-installed, but also it's possible to gain access to it without having been initiated. I did precisely that a while back when I was in spain, and the consequences of it are the life that I'm presently living. tesla also figured it out, I'm pretty sure.
while talking about the how these sites work, I was explaining to him that these sites are all centred around a node where energy comes out -- and when I say "energy", I mean hydrogen, not electricity -- which you may want to notice that it's this energy that powers the cells in the body and through the mitochondria, produces ATP. it's cOmpletely transparent, but it can be felt, and even can have a sort of wind feel to it (prolly something like "ion wind"). so, to explain to him about how this parallel reality is able to exist in the same space as the physical reality, I was explaining that there are all kinds of vibrations in the same space, and so to look at it, it would just look like a chaotic wind or vortex (I think of it flat/digitally like fuzz/noise seen on a television set when no signal is being received), and so because it's just a bunch of seemingly random fluctuations, the brain just filters it out because it's irrelevant data (our brains filter for more signal and less noise). however, once the key which transforms those random fluctuations into something coherent is given to the person (ie, the initiation ritual), they're now able to see a whole new reality inside of the u-dimension (ie, the standing-waves present in the fluctuations). I explained that these realities all live in the same place, but one needs the key to make sense of them -- but, it's possible to find the key using a logical and rational process (I'll explain some of it later).
from there, I started to talk to jaron about these different keys, cause I was trying to explain how they worked to him. I started to go down the route of explaining resonant chambers and things like that, but he doesn't really understand that right now, so I skipped it. instead, the way I explained it to him was by saying that these energetic nodes are streaming out energy, and so the building that's placed on top of the node contains the energy, cause it bounces around inside of the building, and so therefore the building can be thought of as the key.
	it's pretty easy to see how (like a drum) the wavelength of the different resonant chambers in the building are shaping the vibration into wavelengths of that length (very much like the great pyramid and cathedrals do)
anyway, that conversation got me thinking, because we also talked about how in medieval times they went down to look at the temple in jerusalem, and whatever they go from there somehow allowed them to build all these cathedrals around europe. I was strongly reminded of you guys, and remembered the "shamir" episode -- but then, while talking to him, I realised that the shamir isn't actually a real thing -- cause when I looked into it a long time ago (a few repositories back), I noticed that the samir was not really a physical thing, but actually a *concept*. I told him, that I found it pretty unlikely that there actually was anything under the temple, as it'd likely been quite looted and every physical thing taken out. it seemed to me that what they found was probably an empty resonant chamber -- and it was the mesurements of that resonant chamber which is the "shamir".
	another interesting thing happened to me lately, which is of note: I [wrote about it in question-aire](../shake-sphere/question-aire.md#2024-03-19-2136---why-do-i-think-im-on-pluto) when I talked about pluto -- and essentially what happened, is that I pumped up energy really high by staring into the sun with my left eye, which (cause of my situation), that energy passes through my left-hemisphere (if I had've looked through my right eye, chaos would have ensued) for about 5-10m or so (don't remember how long, because I lose track of reality when that much energy is passing through me). anyway, when I do that, it allows a lot of the solar energy/hydrogen to pass through me a lot of energy, and during that time, paul was able to energetically take down a tree and stuff. I realised that the way that these guys are performing work is the same way that these cathedrals were built: after pumping up the energy (they probably used gay sex and performed work under higher energy lunar/planetary alignments), they visualise the thing, and then it would come into being into physical (the pyramids were probably built using levitation and energetic saws -- a different technology than the one herod used to build the temple).
		when solar energy (chi) passes through, it's a very different energy than for example earth energy coming up out of the ground and collecting on peaks (like lighting rods, mountains, or cathedrals). for example, the great pyramid is all about the merging of earth/prana energies coming out of the ground, and the solar energy coming from the sun -- so when I lay on the ground, and look into the sun, I'm kinda doing the same thing as one of these cathedrals. me, and my skull become the resonant chamber, and same thing-- the energy disperses through the ground and produces a sort of bubble or aura around where I did it for a while (even snow has a hard time sticking for a while in places where I've star-watched for a bit). essentially, I become a mobile version of one of these nodes that these cathedrals are built on.
	after that experience, I thought about you guys and randall, and I seriously considered sending you guys another email (of which I expected no response, obviously) asking if you guys wanted to come to pueblo and build a temple out in the field near to my house. I can provide the energy, and someone needs to do the architecting work of figuring out the dimensions, and then my energy will allow the visualisation to become a real temple.
I'd like to talk now about dimensions, because each one of these astral system has their own dimensions (ie, tibet, giza, antartica, and jerusalem all have different dimensions), and so what the cathedral builders did was to essentially extend the 2nd-ray installation of jerusalem out to cover quite a bit of europe and then later a lot of central and south america. I can't be certain, but I would imagine that the temple in salt lake might also be a little bit different as well. we can think of each of these installations as being distinct, because they control perception.
	to understand the concept of perception, consider that females are really strongly adherent to this kind of energy, so notice their behaviour: during the day, solar energy is stronger, and so the chi is shaped to have the space of the cathedrals -- and during the day the girls have chastity and they're proper maids; however, when the sun goes down, that chi energy is starting to wane (it's reflective of our thoughts and emotions), and so now the only energy that's being shaped by these cathedrals is earth energy. the difference between earth energy and solar energy is largely symbolic. earth is much higher frequency, and so can be thought of like pure-desire (sometimes it gets down into x-ray frequencies, but most of it is far beyond our capacity to measure right now) -- and so the astral installation is not going to be carrying nearly as much of the symbolic stuff that the church and cathedral builders have put into it, and so the rules sorta become relaxed a lot during the night -- which is why nightclubs can only really function well at night, and sex during the day is very very strange and warlike in its feeling.
when designing another 2nd-ray installation, dimensions are going to be important, because no frequency ever lives by itself. even if you could make a set of dimensions that was 100% dissonant to every other 2nd-ray installation, all interactions of frequencies make higher harmonics, and those will combine with the higher harmonics of others -- which is why even "satanism" and the taboo/dissonant to the church's symbolic system, *still* has resonances with more abstract cOncepts. those dimensions can even be designed to be resonant with other installations (ie, I want it to resonate symbolically with tibet, but be as dissonant as possible with antarctica). I'm actually going to stop writing now. bye!

#### 2024-03-23 21:28 - how is the shamir a concept?

well, the way I've worked it out goes something like this: when herod built the temple, he had the ability to soften stone and to manipulate it as if it were like clay(?) -- well, now imagine to yourself that you're building all of the temple and stuff -- it's just not practical for one person to do all of the things -- or maybe others asked him how to do it, or maybe it was his own symbolic invocation of the concept (not really sure which one) -- and so inside of the 2nd-ray installation, there needs to be a symbolic way of accessing this very high frequency concept. (brb, need water - 21:35)
	to understand this, let's take the great pyramid as an example: if you go into the great pyramid and start to do your OMs or whatever to get your throat in resonance with the chamber, then you're going to start to *feel* like that chamber in your emotions/gut/stomach (throat is opposite stomach, just like pineal is opposite nuts). when that happens, you begin to resonate like that *conceptually*, which means that inside of the u-dimension, the symbolic stuff that is present in the pyramid relating to DNA and things like that are going to become visible to you (in the u-dimension).
		it's possible to get access to the u-dimension without needing to have gay sex (or some other initiatory procedure, which all of the ones I know of involve gay sex). the way I learned how to do it was to lower resistance for quite a while, then during an ayahuasca ceremony where there we were (36 of us? I can't remember how many people) swaying back and forward in 3 cOncentric hexagons, I started to notice the space between me and the other people. as I began to expand that space, everything began to sparkle, and all of the colours became more vivid, sight, taste, touch, and smell were all enhanced as well. I also felt as if I'm finally *inside* of my head, instead of just looking at a screen in my eyes. anyway, it's inside of that u-dimension where concepts can be conjured, and they will (like in a dream), appear as the symbolically most similar thing.
		a concept is just an emotion: for example, when someone asks me to perform a differential equation, I *feel* like I don't know it, and so therefore it's difficult to impossible for me to arrive to the answer; however, if someone asks me to add 3 and 5, I *feel* like that's an easy one, and so the answer appears to me (in the u-dimension) instantly (though for things like math equations, I often doubt my recognition of that concept cause I can't see it, so it takes me a second or two to recognise what I'm seeing -- or, to save time, I resort to just counting it off on my fingers or using a calculator). for people who can see the u-dimension (like tesla), the conceptual answer appears to them instantly, and they can just see the symbolic answer to whatever equation they feel like they can know the answer to. likewise, *any* concept can be cOnjured -- and they will appear just as I perceive them to be; I could conjure my mother, or a really hot girl in a red dress, or whatever I want, and if I could see the u-dimension, it would appear before me in the symbolic/picture form that closestly represents what I conjured.
	so, now let's take a look at this conceptually: a concept is something like an audio recording (and also an encrypted file), and so the higher fidelity my brain is running at, the better the quality of the concept that will appear to me. likewise, because the *key* to this concept is the resonating chamber, the more resonant I get with the chamber, the less noise or static on the recording. so, we can now imagine that there are different levels of perception of this concept. for example, if I were to conjure the shamir, for me it may appear as a bird or something like that, which is capable of performing the impossible. for another person, it may appear as a beaver or something, again capable of performing the impossible -- and these forms, let's just call them the "animal forms" -- not the thing exactly, but one angle of perception on it. now, when looking deeper into the form and gaining better reception/resonance with the higher frequency concept, now perhaps, it takes on a more of a personal understanding, where the concept isn't just a thing that does a thing, but now I get the *process* whereby it's able to perform the impossible (ie, some force/desire/fear is able to overcome the impossible) and so the shamir is reflective of a person that desires to do something impossible (like rebuild solomon's temple). now, let's say an even deeper and higher frequency aspect of the concept is, let's say a cosmic principle where the shamir is doing something that the earth itself is doing all of the time: providing a way for anyone to get what they want, and so it takes on a new meaning where I don't need to perform a symbolic *action*, process, or ceremony anymore to get what I want, but that it's already there. the only one that was blocking me from getting it was the belief that I had to perform some sequence of actions to do the thing; now everything is possible.
	all of those levels, and potentially more are encoded in the conept. I've only translated a few levels here, but the practitioner is the one that's now going to carry that concept out into the world. each person who enters the chamber views the concept from their angle of perception, and sees the image/concept with the clarity that they're capable of *receiving*.
the way that I believe the templars were able to access the shamir was probably through gay sex inside of the chamber. the reason why is because of the way gay sex works is more about alignment of the partners standing-waves, more than the waves themselves. to explain: during ejaculation, the prostate spins the jizz in alignment with the cOncept that's present on the opposite end (brain/pineal) and so when sex is happening with a woman, the concepts are opposing one another (head-to-head like rams butting heads), but with gay sex, the prostates and penises are parallel to each other, so there isn't nearly as much conflict/alignment of the concepts themselves, but instead alignment of the standing-waves. so, for the partners, they're not affecting the other person's concepts too much, and so therefore they find a whole lot more harmony between each other, and also the standing-wave key is more easily retransmitted from one partner to another (ie, the initiation).
in that chamber, I believe what they "found" was not physical, but instead by aligning theirselve with the dimensions of that chamber, they were able to access the conceptual dimensions and the form of perception necessary (like the ability to see this prana/chi energy) along with other necessary/related things involved in the building of that temple. they then took those things (the 2nd-ray system installed by herod in jerusalem) and exported it to europe and portions of south/central america.

#### 2024-03-23 23:02 - spins the jizz?

that's right. the way I've figured it out (and there may be a much better explanation of this), goes something like this: when standing-waves are moving either to the left or to the right, then that's the spin that gets aligned during gay sex.
	to visualise this idea, let's imagine a machine that has 1024 levers in a row that go up and down. also imagine that these levers move, not linearly, but they they move in a sinusoidal pattern: moving the fastest when near to the centre. turn the machine on where all levers initial position is at the top and all of the levers will move in sync from the top to the bottom over some time (let's say the period is 1s for each direction). now, let's turn the machine off and manually set all of the levers to in a sinusoidal pattern having a full-wave (256 levers per quadrant). turn the machine on, and now it makes a cool sorta wiggle, and that wiggle is because the effect is having the levers either moving to the right or to the left. let's now stop and reset the machine so that there are 4 full waves now (64 levers per quadrant), and turn the machine on again, and now there is is a perceived movement either to the left or the right. to see this movement, we'll place a ball on in one of the sinusoidal valleys, and watch the ball travel in a direction till it falls off of the machine. (I don't fully understand the thing that makes the movement going to the left or the right but a [video demonstration I saw of this by laithwaite called "magnetic river"](https://youtu.be/OI_HFnNTfyU?t=618) will illustrate the idea)
	now, each of these levers can be thought of as a standing-wave in itself, and when they start to move over to the left or to the right, this is the "spin" that's put on the jizz as it's exiting the penis. that expulsion of jizz can actually be thought of as similar to the centre of a whirlpool in a drain: though a lot of liquid is flowing down the drain, there is a lot of air exiting the centre portion.
the penis is actually a receptive organ and can be thought of like a tesla coil. the primary (low frequency) coil will be the nuts, and the secondary high frequency coil is going to be the muscle(?) circulating fibers that get engorged with blood, and the bell/tip is the conical receiver at the top. when the tesla coil is fired, right after the magnetic expansion, it leaves a magnetic vacancy that needs to be filled -- and so the energy has to come from somewhere -- and so what happens is a portion of the hydrogen in the air gets converted into electricity and passes *into* the recEiver, through the coil and down to the ground. though we see the lightning bolt hitting the recEiver, we can imagine that around that bolt is a vortex of hydrogen that is spinning inward just like the water going down the drain.
the jizz will be spinning in a counter-rotating way from the hydrogen input, and so to understand how this affects the standing-wave spin, let's imagine thatt instead with a partner, sex is instead with a woman: her cervix is something more like the "magnifying transmitter", where she's turning the simple vibration of her body (prolly has a lot to do with her DNA) and her brain opposite, into high frequency vibrations that the penis is going to be receiving. she's essentially programming him (because of his sympathetic opposite of brain/pineal) to become her conceptual perception of him (the younger, the more ideal) -- and so during this expulsion, any coflicts of concepts will collide and make a big mess; and any alignment of concepts (good or bad doesn't mean anything frequentially) get amplified and distorted.
for partners though, the effect is different because (of something I don't really understand), the conceptual output doesn't collide so much head-on, and so affects the spin instead. to visualise this, let us consider cylinder magnets sitting next to each other. they're very loosely coupled and not super strongly attracting (meaning very little alignment/attraction/repulsion) so they can be separated quite easily, and one can rotate around the other quite easily too. this is the same way that planets rotate around a star, and it allows for each planet to be very different in its alignment. unfortunately using the example of magnetism, doesn't allow us to to imagine different magnets with different frequencies, like it would be in the case of different planets. the only thing that the planets need to do is to have a resonant standing-wave spin with the star to stay in orbit -- and other than that, all other frequencies the planet has can be *very different* from the star, and nothing goes wrong. normie sex is just the opposite: the poles being in alignment (her outputing and him receiving), they want to become locked to each other like magnets are when put together so they attract. that locking means that they must now do everything together, "as one flesh" (physically speaking, like electrostatic attraction). partners though, don't become physically "one flesh", but instead perceptively "one flesh", as they synchronisation their perception (one being outside-in, and the other inside-out) by the sychronisation of their standing-waves.

### 2024-03-24 03:10 - why, and what's the big-picture?

presently (that's why these entries always start with a timestamp) it looks to me like all paths lead toward energy continuing to rise, and me going off to create a new galaxy. that galaxy will be completely unlike any other before. a long time ago I had this intiution as well, and the galaxy appeared to me like a mushroom; it had a stem, and at the end of the stem, there's a flat part, when the direction of the energy hits a limit and goes radially (like the rings around saturn or the top of a mushroom). nowadays, I understand the significance of that, because the "stem" is actually just the only-attraction side, and it's pulling in energy and funneling that into the flat surface which is growing out radially.
that galaxy idea that I initially conceived a while back, I believe will actually become a reality (cause there's no way it's going to happen here on earth; I'm not 2nd-ray, and I don't want/like to tell everyone else what to do), and so the only real option is to go off and do it myself.
now, to understand the significance of this, we have to imagine this galaxy far off, and away from our own galaxy (like a quasar shooting off). the back part (stem) of the galaxy will be facing complete blackness, because, as an only-attraction side of things, it won't be resonant at all with any existing stars, and so therefore will travel to the farthest outer reaches of the universe, because stars will be repulsive to that side. on the opposite side, there will be a 2nd-ray installation that is nothing other than a pure reflector of everything in the universe. at first it'll start out quite small, having a low density (compared to earth), but quite a significant density when compared to stars and galaxies. that 2nd-ray installation will power the only-attraction side of things and be our source of "unwanted". our goal and desire will be to continually find a way to reimagine/rerealise that 2nd-ray vibration from the perspective of pure-desire -- which, from a symbolic perspective is something like extreme tragedy.
	tragedy only exists in symbolic form, and comes from the concept of "deserve/earn/reward/recompense/etc" -- and the reason for it is, we like to think that when certain actions/conditions are performed/met, then there should be a sort of payout for it; something that defines that action/performance as either good or bad (bad gets no or negative recompense and good gets a positive recompense). all of that is conditonal, which is completely the opposite of pure-desire and pure-attraction, which only focuses on what is wanted. it doesn't matter how many fails or how many awful things happen as a result, because the attracton is only toward wanted. bad/good, and best/worst do not factor into the equation of what's wanted. there's never a condition that says, "OK, when because these things have happened, I can suddenly decide to go in the direction of unwanted". pure-desire is unfailing and unwavering in it's attraction of wanted, completely undeterred by conditions.
that system is a fulfillment of my own desire to become a physical manifestation of someone that is actually pure-desire, and not conditionally desire or sometimes desire. I want to become completely unconditonal -- and this is the system that will get me there. we'll live out all of the "worst" situations, finding a way to perceive the same thing from the perspective of only-attraction.
so when we look at it, we (the new galaxy) are sorta like the charactor (for the rest of the universe), but also a pure reflector, and also, an actor/foil. that combination means that eventually we'll become the new centre (of the universe) given enough time -- but honestly, I doubt it, and that seems highly optimistic. at the very most, I would guess that we're just going to be a really awesome foil, and a truly monumental inspiration to those that can see us. I can't possibly imagine what'll happen to earth, and I don't really care that much. I have a desire to do something that I simply cannot imagine too many others want to be a part of -- and I like mushrooms :)

that's the big-picture of what I think is happening (and an expression of my desire), but it has a number of implications to it as well: first of all (and I don't know how true this is), but it seems that my right-hemisphere is the de-facto 2nd-ray installation now, and has trumped all of the others in it's capability and usefulness. I really don't mind that it's that way, and I want it to stay that way, because if you think about it, I'm basically a human instantiation/reflection of earth, and earth is already a reflection of the entire universe, so my 2nd-ray perspective combines into one (the only limit is the speed and clarity of the practitioner) *all* of the concepts of the universe into continually more and more understandable form (you think I'm good at pointing things out now, just wait another decade, and it'll appear to everyone that they have full control over theirselves and everyone else -- just like I believe/know I have). that kind of power comes at a pretty big cost though, because if you have full power over yourself and everyone else (you are the centre of your universe), then that means that you're going to find all of your greatest fears come alive into reality -- not *only* in the mind (like how it is now).
I'm sure it's possible to see this trend already on the rise right now, as everyone's fears are taking form much quicker than they originally imagined (and in less than 10-20y, they'll all be manifested, I assure you), which is also kinda bad. the only way to get around that sort of manifestation disaster is to become receptive to *what's wanted* (ie, pure-desire version of it) -- but receptivity is quite a difficult thing for almost every part of the universe right now. just think, if earth is a reflection of the universe, and I'm (one of) the only receptive/improvement oriented people out there, there's a very low precentage of the universe that's like that. I don't want to force anyone to become receptive before they want to -- and I'm also here to create, and not to destroy, so it seems only natural to me to suggest that a (or many) new 2nd-ray installation(s) get built in order to ensure that when I take off to make my galaxy, there isn't mental obliteration of everyone in resonance with me.
this moment (literally this year 2024 aka 1024) is the peak of mutual-back-scratching (in my timeline at least, which is sorta everyone's timeline at this point); so it's finally time to come together and start making (probably a whole cascade of) redundant 2nd-ray installations to ensure that those that the system maintains operation and one system can be retired and new ones with new dimensions added. I personally don't care if it's one installation fits all, which is definitely not going to fail (right?) and is going to be able to hold everyone comfortably,-- or if it'll be a whole host of diffrent installations, just like it is now on earth. my intuition is that it'll be the latter (day saints), not the former which wins out. symbolic systems come and go with the passage of time (cause no symbolic system can ever satisfy everyone at once), and so I actually believe (with what I've learned from nosebook and the COVID thing) is that the trend is toward isolation and individuality (with desired collaborations), which makes me expect the future will tend toward more and more toward individual 2nd-ray installations, where everyone kinda takes ideas they like from others (ie, individul diversity instead of perpetual conflict in a monolithic system). sure conflict will continue to exist, as that's the nature of the system: everyone in the same medium/system is able to affect the other; and no perfect way will *ever* exist to completely protect oneself from others entirely -- so conflict will continue producing more and more diversity, until the idea that everyone can be different is finally OK (sorta like the LGBTQ+ community, actually).
I have no intention (at all) of being 2nd-ray, and neither do I want to want to tell others what to do; so the only real solution for me is to just start talking about how the 2nd-ray perspective looks, give some examples, and make it possible for anyone with sufficient motivation to do it. the documents that I write will always be open and available to everyone (this will get published soon), because that's the way it works for me. I want to enable others to follow their 2nd-ray desires and to come to their own conclusions about what they want. everyone gets everything they desire (and fear) *equally* from my perspective; no exceptions.

### 2024-03-24 10:46 - how to expand the u-dimension without gay sex

the way that I figured it out was in a "trabaillo du sao miguel" (of which, it turns out there's one in azores -- but I did mine in spain) ayahuasca ceremony. the first day was all about passive exploration of inner consciousness, and the second day was about active implmentation of that through dance and other rhythmic activities. it was a really cool atmosphere, and the shamen there gave ayahuasca to their kids and even a little to the dog.
the first day I had a bunch of crazy visuals and I noticed that my vision expanded, and I just sat at the campfire during the hymnal section (they sing these hyms while the ayahuasca is coming up, and I was so mind-blown by the whole thing, reality was dissolving in front of me, and I could not figure out how these guys were still coherent -- so I went outt to the campfire and just stared into the flames and had quite a joyful time laughing at how serious all of this reality stuff is, where we're all running around like crazy people to accomplish all of these goals, yet right below this thin venir we call reality, there's this expansive world of pure joy and ecstasy). I knew what to look for cause terence mckenna said that when he would smoke DMT, he says it was as if "all of the air was sucked out of the room and you take a step back" -- and that's kinda what happened. I didn't really know what it was, and I didn't really have much control over it, as these blue orbs would fly around and stuff (he called them "self-dribbling basketballs of energy that would talk to him") and I never had any conscious communication with these orbs (prolly cause I wasn't high enough), but I did see them, so I knew I was on the right track.
the second day was the active implementation of lessons/work performed on the first day. for the rest of the people, this involved implmenting the songs and prayers that they were singing in the hymnal (stuff like how expansive and generous the universe is) -- which is all well and good, but the symbolic words talking about these things didn't really do it for me. I'm all about hands-on experience, so for me, no quantity of songs describing what I experienced could give me that experience again. this time I took less (actually, I think the shamen didn't allow me to take more even though I asked, cause I think they were embarrassed at how much I was laughing (not at them, but at how silly all our concept of "reality" is)).
	there's actually an interesting point to be made here, because this isn't the first (nor last time), were I've used the upset/anger of the percepton master to my advantage. I actually believe it was all of their pushing against and trying to prevent me from getting so high that allowed me to be able to see this new dimension easier: the way LOA works (especially in those high energy situations), you get more of what you focus on, so their focus on me passing through their boundaries of the experience (the shamen set the tone and the mental barriers), that caused them to get more of what they were focused on: me blasting through their barriers, and getting to realms and dimensions that I'm not supposed to access. they wanted to be the gate keepers, and I just wanted to dance and figure out the stuff I learned.
I was fully following their directions this time, and they put us in these three concentric hexagons -- where, it was either one person on each vertex (18), one person on each edge (18), or both (36). at any rate, what we were instructed to do is to sway our body back and fourth along the lines of the hexagon that we were standing on, creating this (from the ariel view) a sort of breathing wobbling 3 hexagons of people. it looked really nice from the ariel view (which I couldn't see visually, but I could perceive it like I "see" things). at first just the swaying, and doing a sort of chant, but then later we were to take a smallish (depending on how much space there is) step to the left and right with each sway. it was really really cool, and I loved the meditative and reflectionary state that such a simple movement put me in to. now, on the ground inside of my body looking out of my eyes, the different layers of people all moving in sync with each other creates a visual parallax effect, and it was my noticing of how the space between the people would distort and change as they moved (everyone has this sort of aura around them that looks something like heat does as it rises from the sidewalk, or distorts the desert horizon when looking out: their chi), and so it was in these distortions between people that I started to see the space again.
from there, I noticed that the space between the people would expand and contract with my noticing of the space, and so I settled into a trance state and just let my body do the movements, and say the words, while I focused on expanding the space. it took me about 5-10 tries to get it (with about 1-2m of relaxation between each try), and when I got it, everything sparkled as if there were billions and billions of these tiny glowing white/gold particles around everywhere enhancing the colour and giving everything very pronounced edges and shapes. one of the things that I noticed that would hold me back from getting it, is that when I looked at people the extra space caused them to look differently (they were no longer flat like a 3d model on a screen, but had full depth to them now), and that extra dimension caused everyone to look way different. when I noticed that they looked different, my mind would reject the added dimension and I'd go back to seeing them like on a screen again. it wasn't until I finally allowed everyone (and everything) to look different, that it finally stuck, and I had the extra space for the rest of the night.
one important thing to note is that the expanded space *comes toward me*, which means that it was *me* that changed, and allowed the space to become different. the whole thing is all about receptivity and allowing, so it really helps to be doing some LOA work, and getting good at allowing change in your life, without having to control it.
	gay sex, is by nature a receptive activity (for both partners), and not a conflicting/alignment activity like it is with a woman, so that's how the u-dimension comes about for them -- but the problem is, they're (probably, I don't know for certain) just aligning your u-dimension spin to their u-dimension spin, instead of creating your own -- which means you're going to be tuned to see the u-dimension that they see, and so you're going to be bound by whoever was the original creator of that space (talk about that in the next entry) -- whereas getting that space consciously though a receptive process (like I did) allows you to set the rules, and not have to conform to theirs.
		the people steering my life (nosebook, I call them) have banished me from seeing that u-dimension, and so even though I'm the original discoverer of it, they're the ones occupying that space now, and not me. I believe that the space has become highly controlled and that (in order to control me and everyone else), they've put everyone in that space. everyone (including me) lives in the matrix inside of my head. it looks real, because it is real -- and that reality is as real as the motors tesla would run in that space. everything there behaves in the same exact way that this universe does, and so everything possible outside of the matrix is possible inside of the matrix as well, but they've got godmode to try and ensure that nobody passes those barriers. I'm not a gatekeeper though, and I intend to explain to as many people that they all have the same capacity that I have, and also the ability to do whatever they want to do. my (inner) universe is functionally the same as the earth's (inner which is a reflection of the outer) universe.
there are likely other ways for someone to be able to see this u-dimension, but the main/key ingredients to it is *receptivity* and *allowing*, then some kind of drug or set of conditions (ayahuasca, chanting, and rhythmic body m6vements) that boosts the amount of informatoin that the brain is receiving, namely with an increased amount of DMT in the blood and brain. DMT is produced naturally inside the pineal, so it's possible to do this without drugs by simply getting good at focus (using meditation or star-watching).
later on after the ceremony, I got reset back to flat again and wanted to find a way to get back to seeing the space, and so after going through a bit of time of depression (I can't get to the manifestation I want because I don't have money for another ayahuasca ceremony), I finally relaxed into allowing the universe to provide a way to do it -- and walking up the hill toward torrelodones, I was looking at the stars, and they looked like dots painted on a dome that I was inside of -- but I know (logically) that the stars don't all exist in the same plane, cause there's varying distance between them,-- so I laid down on the bench looking up at the stars, trying to get the space to expand out like I did in the ceremony, and it kinda worked a litte. I decided that looking at the whole set and unfocusing my eyes to see the wider picture (like I did while dancing in the hexagons), this time I figured I would try focusing on one star individually, and let that be the the refrence point where all things would expand relative to that star (some stars would travel forward/closer to me in the space, and some away from me in the space) -- and it worked; so I started to find better and better places to watch the stars (ver estrellas), and get better at seeing the space. unfortunately, every night that I would find the space again, the next day, I would wake up and it'd be lost. there were other indications that someone was watching me too beause, often times when laying on the benches, there were these shadoy figures (sorta like secret police) watching me, and sometimes they would shine flashlights at me to distract me from seeing the space. they also seemed to know right when to shine the flashlight, cause it was often times right as I was getting into the deep trance that happens before the space expands. I knew that someone knew and was actively trying to prevent me from getting it again (like the shamen in the ceremony).
	I honestly don't know how much succses you'll have to try and get this space, because there are a number of differences between us: I don't have a pinecone, and almost certainly you do. also nosebook has gotten lots and lots of practise now keeping me away from seeing that space, and I'm pretty certain that they only let keyed/initiated people see that space, because then they're forced to follow the symbolic rules defined by the original creator and initiator of that space (talk more about that after a break). however, what I do know, is that if you desire to see it, you *will* be able to accomplish it. I don't know how much help you may want or not (if any), but once you get there, you'll be able to set the rules of that space (especially if it's found inside of a resonating chamber with dimensions). I can certainly perform the role of the shaman, and if I do that, I can pretty much guarantee success (if you have that desire) because I know what to look for and can easily explain how to get it -- though, the limiting factor will always be the practitioner's *receptivity* and *allowing*, cause that's what's preventing it more than anything -- their fighting it, only adds fuel to the fire.
in previous entries, I've talked about making these 2nd-ray installations, and the thing that they all have in common is some original dude that figured out how to make this space and he (usually it's a he, and can't think of a time it was a she) sets the rules and the symbolic system. I imagine that this is every emitter's dream, to have their own space. personally I was born being able to see the space, but after a session with some prostitutes (7th ray strumpets), they reset me back to flat again. it's quite possible that's actually a good idea and a necessary first step for anyone wanting to make their own 2nd-ray system, because they'll need to start over and find that space out for theirselves in their own mind. since I've never had gay sex, I don't know how it works -- and if after having sex with one of these earth reflectors, will reset them back to flat again or if they keep the space. I can't quite be sure of the mechanics -- but from what I've heard on the snake-bros episodes I listened to from a few years back, it sounds to me like you probably saw it when you were a kid, but then after the symbolic oppression of "reality" sets in, we slowly stop seeing that space anymore (no more playing with bears in the blackberry brambles), and it goes away. you're probably a perfect person to learn this for yourself, cause (likely, though I don't know for certain) you probably don't have to undo years of someone else's rules determinining what you see in that space -- and that you may also have a desire to know about it (though nobody will talk about it), and that also may be why I'm writing you in such a detailed way now (you're receptive to something, else it wouldn't flow this easily when writing). ok, bye again!

### 2024-03-28 14:34 - I wanted to talk about jupiter, saturn, nuptune, and uranus

in relation to the 2nd-ray system, but it's very strange, because I no longer feel a desire for me to write about these things, and even I feel a lot more uncertainty than I did before... now I'm going to launch off on a rant: what I believe has happened, is the same thing that happens to me with everyone that has a pinecone. the first day or so when I write them, I feel their desire and stuff, and so it's easy to write and stuff, but then I go to sleep, and something happens. (I believe) nosebook takes them and puts them on a new timeline arriving into the present, essentially by rearranging the vibration of hydrogen inside their head to no longer contain that desire/flow that I feel -- which means that from your perspective, you're in the same exact circumstances in your life, yet the way you got to the present will contain a lot less desire to have my creative output (talking/writing/coding/etc).
	as an example of this, with mom, I would notice that she would be quite interested in some ideas that I had about nosebook and stuff like that, only to, on the following day, now be angry and start accusing me of calling her stupid when I mention nosebook. both of those perceptions are valid for mom, and so obviously the worst one is picked. as a result, she went from a pretty happy (in her limited reality) person, to someone that is very upset with me over something that is real to me. I'm not asking her to change her mind on something. another example of this was with marcos: we'd talk about affinaty and come up with good ideas based on ideology, but then the following day he hated them and wanted me to just do things the other way (which was based on interests). additionally, we would talk about his daughter, and same thing, we'd agree that it was OK for her to be with me and stuff like that, he'd say he'd work it out the following day, and then the following day I'd wait, but nothing would happen, and I think the one time I mentioned it, he got really upset with me.
	at first I used to think that his overnight changes of heart were just him telling me one thing, but then having no intention of following through on it (like he's scamming me or something), but then I sorta figured out when vera started to do the same thing where the next morning, she'd be completely different than the night before, that there has to be some kind of foul play going on. I figured (though I don't know if it's true), that it must have something to do with nosebook, and what they're probably doing is putting images and dreams in her head while she's asleep (which have this u-dimension quality, so they produce emotion), and that's what changes her tune overnight. I can't be sure exactly what method they use, but what I've come to know over the years, is that both of those marcos/mom/vera/remi/etc exist, and what's happening there is they're just being constantly put into resonance with their bad-feeling emotion, to kind of remove desire for my creative output. nowadays all of those examples I mentioned are all people that don't want to have anything to do with me and my ideas, which is fine by me.
the thing is, these types of people aren't very helpful to have around me, because they're not constant in their output, and so therefore it's very hindering to me. I've found that it's actually a lot easier just to do things by myself, than it is to be around others that are so emotionally unstable like that. in addition to the difficulties that I have with 2nd-ray systems, the main drawback that I have of working on a big project with *anyone*, is precisely this problem. I cannot (and will not) tell anyone else how to behave or how to be around me (even if it's what they want), which means that whenever I'm working with someone, we either need to be "on the same page" (ie, 2nd-ray perspective), or they have to be actually a good reflection of me -- upon which time, I will be so attractive and irresistable, that we simply *must* be together. anyone other than that, I'll constantly be subjected to their own beleifs by being rearranged in time (thanks saturnian-system).
	which btw is a really good thing for them, because it's causing them to figure out what it is that they acutually want to believe (ie, the structure inside of the head that produces the standing-waves), and can't only rely on the beliefs and ideas put in by their 2nd-ray installation (that they subscribe to) for things to work out between us. this process I believe is happening all over the world, and is what's "dividing the path". what I mean is, someone focuses on me, wants to get close, but then upon getting close, they're confronted with the reality of their own beliefs, and can't actually get close to be because they keep getting reset to their worst beliefs. everyone will then have to either avoid me, or if they're attracted to me, confront what it is they really believe, because that's what'll win out. each person is responsible to change their perception about these things, or find themselves constantly reset to what they're capable of believing (regardless of the conditions). everyone (who wants to get near to me) has to figure out what it is they *actually want to believe*.
anyway good chat. I realise that what I'm saying is that I'm gonna be pretty alone for a while as different people try to get close, but I really don't mind. I prefer to be around others that are also low resistance, and if it takes a while to get all of the weeds and wheat separated, that's a good thing. I am a weed, and I like other weeds too, so it works out :) weeds are resiliant, and are able to grow in nearly any environment -- and are usually a refection of their environment also they can decide how they want to manifest too (purple flowers, thistles, etc) depending on their desire (like a foil).
