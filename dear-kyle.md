### 2024-03-23 15:51 - stone masonry and beyond

last night I launched off into a discussion with jaron, and there was an interesting dynamic to it because he was standing at the top of the stairs, and I at the bottom. that's interesting because I'm usually above him or the same height as him if I'm seated (he sits in a wheelchair) while we talk. the other interesting thing about it, is numerous times while stoned (which makes me significantly more sensitive to energy), standing at the top of the stairs like that is a kinda trippy experience. I often times like to just stand at the top of the stairs there and let my mind wander a bit.
our discussion started out talking about jews and how spain used to be sorta like the wild west before they got kicked out of spain by isabella and ferdinand (17:09 - paused for a few hours(wtf?) to read wikipedia about). from there, we started talking about these different sacred sites, and my ideas on them. we talked about tibet, jerusalem, giza, and stuff like that -- cause I was telling him that the physical attributes of the place, everyone can see cause it's just a bunch of rocks, but there's a parallel reality there that isn't normally visible. I explained how certain genetics come with accses to those astral zones pre-installed, but also it's possible to gain access to it without having been initiated. I did precisely that a while back when I was in spain, and the consequences of it are the life that I'm presently living. tesla also figured it out, I'm pretty sure.
while talking about the how these sites work, I was explaining to him that these sites are all centred around a node where energy comes out -- and when I say "energy", I mean hydrogen, not electricity -- which you may want to notice that it's this energy that powers the cells in the body and through the mitochondria, produces ATP. it's cOmpletely transparent, but it can be felt, and even can have a sort of wind feel to it (prolly something like "ion wind"). so, to explain to him about how this parallel reality is able to exist in the same space as the physical reality, I was explaining that there are all kinds of vibrations in the same space, and so to look at it, it would just look like a chaotic wind or vortex (I think of it flat/digitally like fuzz/noise seen on a television set when no signal is being received), and so because it's just a bunch of seemingly random fluctuations, the brain just filters it out because it's irrelevant data (our brains filter for more signal and less noise). however, once the key which transforms those random fluctuations into something coherent is given to the person (ie, the initiation ritual), they're now able to see a whole new reality inside of the u-dimension (ie, the standing-waves present in the fluctuations). I explained that these realities all live in the same place, but one needs the key to make sense of them -- but, it's possible to find the key using a logical and rational process (I'll explain some of it later).
from there, I started to talk to jaron about these different keys, cause I was trying to explain how they worked to him. I started to go down the route of explaining resonant chambers and things like that, but he doesn't really understand that right now, so I skipped it. instead, the way I explained it to him was by saying that these energetic nodes are streaming out energy, and so the building that's placed on top of the node contains the energy, cause it bounces around inside of the building, and so therefore the building can be thought of as the key.
	it's pretty easy to see how (like a drum) the wavelength of the different resonant chambers in the building are shaping the vibration into wavelengths of that length (very much like the great pyramid and cathedrals do)
anyway, that conversation got me thinking, because we also talked about how in medieval times they went down to look at the temple in jerusalem, and whatever they go from there somehow allowed them to build all these cathedrals around europe. I was strongly reminded of you guys, and remembered the "shamir" episode -- but then, while talking to him, I realised that the shamir isn't actually a real thing -- cause when I looked into it a long time ago (a few repositories back), I noticed that the samir was not really a physical thing, but actually a *concept*. I told him, that I found it pretty unlikely that there actually was anything under the temple, as it'd likely been quite looted and every physical thing taken out. it seemed to me that what they found was probably an empty resonant chamber -- and it was the mesurements of that resonant chamber which is the "shamir".
	another interesting thing happened to me lately, which is of note: I [wrote about it in question-aire](../shake-sphere/question-aire.md#2024-03-19-2136---why-do-i-think-im-on-pluto) when I talked about pluto -- and essentially what happened, is that I pumped up energy really high by staring into the sun with my left eye, which (cause of my situation), that energy passes through my left-hemisphere (if I had've looked through my right eye, chaos would have ensued) for about 5-10m or so (don't remember how long, because I lose track of reality when that much energy is passing through me). anyway, when I do that, it allows a lot of the solar energy/hydrogen to pass through me a lot of energy, and during that time, paul was able to energetically take down a tree and stuff. I realised that the way that these guys are performing work is the same way that these cathedrals were built: after pumping up the energy (they probably used gay sex and performed work under higher energy lunar/planetary alignments), they visualise the thing, and then it would come into being into physical (the pyramids were probably built using levitation and energetic saws -- a different technology than the one herod used to build the temple).
		when solar energy (chi) passes through, it's a very different energy than for example earth energy coming up out of the ground and collecting on peaks (like lighting rods, mountains, or cathedrals). for example, the great pyramid is all about the merging of earth/prana energies coming out of the ground, and the solar energy coming from the sun -- so when I lay on the ground, and look into the sun, I'm kinda doing the same thing as one of these cathedrals. me, and my skull become the resonant chamber, and same thing-- the energy disperses through the ground and produces a sort of bubble or aura around where I did it for a while (even snow has a hard time sticking for a while in places where I've star-watched for a bit). essentially, I become a mobile version of one of these nodes that these cathedrals are built on.
	after that experience, I thought about you guys and randall, and I seriously considered sending you guys another email (of which I expected no response, obviously) asking if you guys wanted to come to pueblo and build a temple out in the field near to my house. I can provide the energy, and someone needs to do the architecting work of figuring out the dimensions, and then my energy will allow the visualisation to become a real temple.
I'd like to talk now about dimensions, because each one of these astral system has their own dimensions (ie, tibet, giza, antartica, and jerusalem all have different dimensions), and so what the cathedral builders did was to essentially extend the 2nd-ray installation of jerusalem out to cover quite a bit of europe and then later a lot of central and south america. I can't be certain, but I would imagine that the temple in salt lake might also be a little bit different as well. we can think of each of these installations as being distinct, because they control perception.
	to understand the concept of perception, consider that females are really strongly adherent to this kind of energy, so notice their behaviour: during the day, solar energy is stronger, and so the chi is shaped to have the space of the cathedrals -- and during the day the girls have chastity and they're proper maids; however, when the sun goes down, that chi energy is starting to wane (it's reflective of our thoughts and emotions), and so now the only energy that's being shaped by these cathedrals is earth energy. the difference between earth energy and solar energy is largely symbolic. earth is much higher frequency, and so can be thought of like pure-desire (sometimes it gets down into x-ray frequencies, but most of it is far beyond our capacity to measure right now) -- and so the astral installation is not going to be carrying nearly as much of the symbolic stuff that the church and cathedral builders have put into it, and so the rules sorta become relaxed a lot during the night -- which is why nightclubs can only really function well at night, and sex during the day is very very strange and warlike in its feeling.
when designing another 2nd-ray installation, dimensions are going to be important, because no frequency ever lives by itself. even if you could make a set of dimensions that was 100% dissonant to every other 2nd-ray installation, all interactions of frequencies make higher harmonics, and those will combine with the higher harmonics of others -- which is why even "satanism" and the taboo/dissonant to the church's symbolic system, *still* has resonances with more abstract cOncepts. those dimensions can even be designed to be resonant with other installations (ie, I want it to resonate symbolically with tibet, but be as dissonant as possible with antarctica). I'm actually going to stop writing now. bye!

#### 2024-03-23 21:28 - how is the shamir a concept?

well, the way I've worked it out goes something like this: when herod built the temple, he had the ability to soften stone and to manipulate it as if it were like clay(?) -- well, now imagine to yourself that you're building all of the temple and stuff -- it's just not practical for one person to do all of the things -- or maybe others asked him how to do it, or maybe it was his own symbolic invocation of the concept (not really sure which one) -- and so inside of the 2nd-ray installation, there needs to be a symbolic way of accessing this very high frequency concept. (brb, need water - 21:35)
	to understand this, let's take the great pyramid as an example: if you go into the great pyramid and start to do your OMs or whatever to get your throat in resonance with the chamber, then you're going to start to *feel* like that chamber in your emotions/gut/stomach (throat is opposite stomach, just like pineal is opposite nuts). when that happens, you begin to resonate like that *conceptually*, which means that inside of the u-dimension, the symbolic stuff that is present in the pyramid relating to DNA and things like that are going to become visible to you (in the u-dimension).
		it's possible to get access to the u-dimension without needing to have gay sex (or some other initiatory procedure, which all of the ones I know of involve gay sex). the way I learned how to do it was to lower resistance for quite a while, then during an ayahuasca ceremony where there we were (36 of us? I can't remember how many people) swaying back and forward in 3 cOncentric hexagons, I started to notice the space between me and the other people. as I began to expand that space, everything began to sparkle, and all of the colours became more vivid, sight, taste, touch, and smell were all enhanced as well. I also felt as if I'm finally *inside* of my head, instead of just looking at a screen in my eyes. anyway, it's inside of that u-dimension where concepts can be conjured, and they will (like in a dream), appear as the symbolically most similar thing.
		a concept is just an emotion: for example, when someone asks me to perform a differential equation, I *feel* like I don't know it, and so therefore it's difficult to impossible for me to arrive to the answer; however, if someone asks me to add 3 and 5, I *feel* like that's an easy one, and so the answer appears to me (in the u-dimension) instantly (though for things like math equations, I often doubt my recognition of that concept cause I can't see it, so it takes me a second or two to recognise what I'm seeing -- or, to save time, I resort to just counting it off on my fingers or using a calculator). for people who can see the u-dimension (like tesla), the conceptual answer appears to them instantly, and they can just see the symbolic answer to whatever equation they feel like they can know the answer to. likewise, *any* concept can be cOnjured -- and they will appear just as I perceive them to be; I could conjure my mother, or a really hot girl in a red dress, or whatever I want, and if I could see the u-dimension, it would appear before me in the symbolic/picture form that closestly represents what I conjured.
	so, now let's take a look at this conceptually: a concept is something like an audio recording (and also an encrypted file), and so the higher fidelity my brain is running at, the better the quality of the concept that will appear to me. likewise, because the *key* to this concept is the resonating chamber, the more resonant I get with the chamber, the less noise or static on the recording. so, we can now imagine that there are different levels of perception of this concept. for example, if I were to conjure the shamir, for me it may appear as a bird or something like that, which is capable of performing the impossible. for another person, it may appear as a beaver or something, again capable of performing the impossible -- and these forms, let's just call them the "animal forms" -- not the thing exactly, but one angle of perception on it. now, when looking deeper into the form and gaining better reception/resonance with the higher frequency concept, now perhaps, it takes on a more of a personal understanding, where the concept isn't just a thing that does a thing, but now I get the *process* whereby it's able to perform the impossible (ie, some force/desire/fear is able to overcome the impossible) and so the shamir is reflective of a person that desires to do something impossible (like rebuild solomon's temple). now, let's say an even deeper and higher frequency aspect of the concept is, let's say a cosmic principle where the shamir is doing something that the earth itself is doing all of the time: providing a way for anyone to get what they want, and so it takes on a new meaning where I don't need to perform a symbolic *action*, process, or ceremony anymore to get what I want, but that it's already there. the only one that was blocking me from getting it was the belief that I had to perform some sequence of actions to do the thing; now everything is possible.
	all of those levels, and potentially more are encoded in the conept. I've only translated a few levels here, but the practitioner is the one that's now going to carry that concept out into the world. each person who enters the chamber views the concept from their angle of perception, and sees the image/concept with the clarity that they're capable of *receiving*.
the way that I believe the templars were able to access the shamir was probably through gay sex inside of the chamber. the reason why is because of the way gay sex works is more about alignment of the partners standing-waves, more than the waves themselves. to explain: during ejaculation, the prostate spins the jizz in alignment with the cOncept that's present on the opposite end (brain/pineal) and so when sex is happening with a woman, the concepts are opposing one another (head-to-head like rams butting heads), but with gay sex, the prostates and penises are parallel to each other, so there isn't nearly as much conflict/alignment of the concepts themselves, but instead alignment of the standing-waves. so, for the partners, they're not affecting the other person's concepts too much, and so therefore they find a whole lot more harmony between each other, and also the standing-wave key is more easily retransmitted from one partner to another (ie, the initiation).
in that chamber, I believe what they "found" was not physical, but instead by aligning theirselve with the dimensions of that chamber, they were able to access the conceptual dimensions and the form of perception necessary (like the ability to see this prana/chi energy) along with other necessary/related things involved in the building of that temple. they then took those things (the 2nd-ray system installed by herod in jerusalem) and exported it to europe and portions of south/central america.

#### 2024-03-23 23:02 - spins the jizz?

that's right. the way I've figured it out (and there may be a much better explanation of this), goes something like this: when standing-waves are moving either to the left or to the right, then that's the spin that gets aligned during gay sex.
	to visualise this idea, let's imagine a machine that has 1024 levers in a row that go up and down. also imagine that these levers move, not linearly, but they they move in a sinusoidal pattern: moving the fastest when near to the centre. turn the machine on where all levers initial position is at the top and all of the levers will move in sync from the top to the bottom over some time (let's say the period is 1s for each direction). now, let's turn the machine off and manually set all of the levers to in a sinusoidal pattern having a full-wave (256 levers per quadrant). turn the machine on, and now it makes a cool sorta wiggle, and that wiggle is because the effect is having the levers either moving to the right or to the left. let's now stop and reset the machine so that there are 4 full waves now (64 levers per quadrant), and turn the machine on again, and now there is is a perceived movement either to the left or the right. to see this movement, we'll place a ball on in one of the sinusoidal valleys, and watch the ball travel in a direction till it falls off of the machine. (I don't fully understand the thing that makes the movement going to the left or the right but a [video demonstration I saw of this by laithwaite called "magnetic river"](https://youtu.be/OI_HFnNTfyU?t=618) will illustrate the idea)
	now, each of these levers can be thought of as a standing-wave in itself, and when they start to move over to the left or to the right, this is the "spin" that's put on the jizz as it's exiting the penis. that expulsion of jizz can actually be thought of as similar to the centre of a whirlpool in a drain: though a lot of liquid is flowing down the drain, there is a lot of air exiting the centre portion.
the penis is actually a receptive organ and can be thought of like a tesla coil. the primary (low frequency) coil will be the nuts, and the secondary high frequency coil is going to be the muscle(?) circulating fibers that get engorged with blood, and the bell/tip is the conical receiver at the top. when the tesla coil is fired, right after the magnetic expansion, it leaves a magnetic vacancy that needs to be filled -- and so the energy has to come from somewhere -- and so what happens is a portion of the hydrogen in the air gets converted into electricity and passes *into* the recEiver, through the coil and down to the ground. though we see the lightning bolt hitting the recEiver, we can imagine that around that bolt is a vortex of hydrogen that is spinning inward just like the water going down the drain.
the jizz will be spinning in a counter-rotating way from the hydrogen input, and so to understand how this affects the standing-wave spin, let's imagine thatt instead with a partner, sex is instead with a woman: her cervix is something more like the "magnifying transmitter", where she's turning the simple vibration of her body (prolly has a lot to do with her DNA) and her brain opposite, into high frequency vibrations that the penis is going to be receiving. she's essentially programming him (because of his sympathetic opposite of brain/pineal) to become her conceptual perception of him (the younger, the more ideal) -- and so during this expulsion, any coflicts of concepts will collide and make a big mess; and any alignment of concepts (good or bad doesn't mean anything frequentially) get amplified and distorted.
for partners though, the effect is different because (of something I don't really understand), the conceptual output doesn't collide so much head-on, and so affects the spin instead. to visualise this, let us consider cylinder magnets sitting next to each other. they're very loosely coupled and not super strongly attracting (meaning very little alignment/attraction/repulsion) so they can be separated quite easily, and one can rotate around the other quite easily too. this is the same way that planets rotate around a star, and it allows for each planet to be very different in its alignment. unfortunately using the example of magnetism, doesn't allow us to to imagine different magnets with different frequencies, like it would be in the case of different planets. the only thing that the planets need to do is to have a resonant standing-wave spin with the star to stay in orbit -- and other than that, all other frequencies the planet has can be *very different* from the star, and nothing goes wrong. normie sex is just the opposite: the poles being in alignment (her outputing and him receiving), they want to become locked to each other like magnets are when put together so they attract. that locking means that they must now do everything together, "as one flesh" (physically speaking, like electrostatic attraction). partners though, don't become physically "one flesh", but instead perceptively "one flesh", as they synchronisation their perception (one being outside-in, and the other inside-out) by the sychronisation of their standing-waves.

### 2024-03-24 03:10 - why, and what's the big-picture?

presently (that's why these entries always start with a timestamp) it looks to me like all paths lead toward energy continuing to rise, and me going off to create a new galaxy. that galaxy will be completely unlike any other before. a long time ago I had this intiution as well, and the galaxy appeared to me like a mushroom; it had a stem, and at the end of the stem, there's a flat part, when the direction of the energy hits a limit and goes radially (like the rings around saturn or the top of a mushroom). nowadays, I understand the significance of that, because the "stem" is actually just the only-attraction side, and it's pulling in energy and funneling that into the flat surface which is growing out radially.
that galaxy idea that I initially conceived a while back, I believe will actually become a reality (cause there's no way it's going to happen here on earth; I'm not 2nd-ray, and I don't want/like to tell everyone else what to do), and so the only real option is to go off and do it myself.
now, to understand the significance of this, we have to imagine this galaxy far off, and away from our own galaxy (like a quasar shooting off). the back part (stem) of the galaxy will be facing complete blackness, because, as an only-attraction side of things, it won't be resonant at all with any existing stars, and so therefore will travel to the farthest outer reaches of the universe, because stars will be repulsive to that side. on the opposite side, there will be a 2nd-ray installation that is nothing other than a pure reflector of everything in the universe. at first it'll start out quite small, having a low density (compared to earth), but quite a significant density when compared to stars and galaxies. that 2nd-ray installation will power the only-attraction side of things and be our source of "unwanted". our goal and desire will be to continually find a way to reimagine/rerealise that 2nd-ray vibration from the perspective of pure-desire -- which, from a symbolic perspective is something like extreme tragedy.
	tragedy only exists in symbolic form, and comes from the concept of "deserve/earn/reward/recompense/etc" -- and the reason for it is, we like to think that when certain actions/conditions are performed/met, then there should be a sort of payout for it; something that defines that action/performance as either good or bad (bad gets no or negative recompense and good gets a positive recompense). all of that is conditonal, which is completely the opposite of pure-desire and pure-attraction, which only focuses on what is wanted. it doesn't matter how many fails or how many awful things happen as a result, because the attracton is only toward wanted. bad/good, and best/worst do not factor into the equation of what's wanted. there's never a condition that says, "OK, when because these things have happened, I can suddenly decide to go in the direction of unwanted". pure-desire is unfailing and unwavering in it's attraction of wanted, completely undeterred by conditions.
that system is a fulfillment of my own desire to become a physical manifestation of someone that is actually pure-desire, and not conditionally desire or sometimes desire. I want to become completely unconditonal -- and this is the system that will get me there. we'll live out all of the "worst" situations, finding a way to perceive the same thing from the perspective of only-attraction.
so when we look at it, we (the new galaxy) are sorta like the charactor (for the rest of the universe), but also a pure reflector, and also, an actor/foil. that combination means that eventually we'll become the new centre (of the universe) given enough time -- but honestly, I doubt it, and that seems highly optimistic. at the very most, I would guess that we're just going to be a really awesome foil, and a truly monumental inspiration to those that can see us. I can't possibly imagine what'll happen to earth, and I don't really care that much. I have a desire to do something that I simply cannot imagine too many others want to be a part of -- and I like mushrooms :)

that's the big-picture of what I think is happening (and an expression of my desire), but it has a number of implications to it as well: first of all (and I don't know how true this is), but it seems that my right-hemisphere is the de-facto 2nd-ray installation now, and has trumped all of the others in it's capability and usefulness. I really don't mind that it's that way, and I want it to stay that way, because if you think about it, I'm basically a human instantiation/reflection of earth, and earth is already a reflection of the entire universe, so my 2nd-ray perspective combines into one (the only limit is the speed and clarity of the practitioner) *all* of the concepts of the universe into continually more and more understandable form (you think I'm good at pointing things out now, just wait another decade, and it'll appear to everyone that they have full control over theirselves and everyone else -- just like I believe/know I have). that kind of power comes at a pretty big cost though, because if you have full power over yourself and everyone else (you are the centre of your universe), then that means that you're going to find all of your greatest fears come alive into reality -- not *only* in the mind (like how it is now).
I'm sure it's possible to see this trend already on the rise right now, as everyone's fears are taking form much quicker than they originally imagined (and in less than 10-20y, they'll all be manifested, I assure you), which is also kinda bad. the only way to get around that sort of manifestation disaster is to become receptive to *what's wanted* (ie, pure-desire version of it) -- but receptivity is quite a difficult thing for almost every part of the universe right now. just think, if earth is a reflection of the universe, and I'm (one of) the only receptive/improvement oriented people out there, there's a very low precentage of the universe that's like that. I don't want to force anyone to become receptive before they want to -- and I'm also here to create, and not to destroy, so it seems only natural to me to suggest that a (or many) new 2nd-ray installation(s) get built in order to ensure that when I take off to make my galaxy, there isn't mental obliteration of everyone in resonance with me.
this moment (literally this year 2024 aka 1024) is the peak of mutual-back-scratching (in my timeline at least, which is sorta everyone's timeline at this point); so it's finally time to come together and start making (probably a whole cascade of) redundant 2nd-ray installations to ensure that those that the system maintains operation and one system can be retired and new ones with new dimensions added. I personally don't care if it's one installation fits all, which is definitely not going to fail (right?) and is going to be able to hold everyone comfortably,-- or if it'll be a whole host of diffrent installations, just like it is now on earth. my intuition is that it'll be the latter (day saints), not the former which wins out. symbolic systems come and go with the passage of time (cause no symbolic system can ever satisfy everyone at once), and so I actually believe (with what I've learned from nosebook and the COVID thing) is that the trend is toward isolation and individuality (with desired collaborations), which makes me expect the future will tend toward more and more toward individual 2nd-ray installations, where everyone kinda takes ideas they like from others (ie, individul diversity instead of perpetual conflict in a monolithic system). sure conflict will continue to exist, as that's the nature of the system: everyone in the same medium/system is able to affect the other; and no perfect way will *ever* exist to completely protect oneself from others entirely -- so conflict will continue producing more and more diversity, until the idea that everyone can be different is finally OK (sorta like the gay community, actually).
I have no intention (at all) of being 2nd-ray, and neither do I want to want to tell others what to do; so the only real solution for me is to just start talking about how the 2nd-ray perspective looks, give some examples, and make it possible for anyone with sufficient motivation to do it. the documents that I write will always be open and available to everyone (this will get published soon), because that's the way it works for me. I want to enable others to follow their 2nd-ray desires and to come to their own conclusions about what they want. everyone gets everything they desire (and fear) *equally* from my perspective; no exceptions.
