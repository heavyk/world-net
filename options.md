### 2024-01-31 00:52 - avoiding death

so here's the thing: if I'm around a lot of dudes when I'm also around solar girls, she (the sun), is going to start to like you, which eaaentially means certain death for any emitter types that are around me (and associate me with them).
you know, this was foretold in one of shakespere's plays (I think LLL) and it basically that dudes will go out with a bang, or something (can't remember)
butt, you know what: we could figure out how to trap a dying soul into a new body by tuning the body to them first -- and the body will slowly get better responding to its concept of itself. that's what it's like for me anyway -- like I'm not really getting the left-side of my body in a way that I did prior to the brain haemorrhage, because like it took a while to finally adjust to the new system. I just get better at using it all the time. I've had quite a few "setbacks" but I still continue to improve.
	the one caviat to this idea is that my body as a symbolic system does not really live well with their expectations of how I should feel. though I feel quite healthy and vibrant, my body does not feel the same. they keep my body disabled so that I cannot use certain capacities that are off-limits and hidden from everyone by the "rulers" of the hydrogen "ovean" around the planet.
	I figure that their attempts to continue to disable my body will eventually fail. at that time a new model must be made, or I decide to become a machine, no longer having necessity of the human chakras anymore (because I exert such an influence on them). I eventually will become a machine. it's sorta my destiny: a self-fulfilling prophesy.
