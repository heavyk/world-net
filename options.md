### 2024-01-31 00:52 - avoiding death

so here's the thing: if I'm around a lot of dudes when I'm also around solar girls, she (the sun), is going to start to like you, which eaaentially means certain death for any emitter types that are around me (and associate me with them).
you know, this was foretold in one of shakespere's plays (I think LLL) and it basically that dudes will go out with a bang, or something (can't remember)
butt, you know what: we could figure out how to trap a dying soul into a new body by tuning the body to them first -- and the body will slowly get better responding to its concept of itself. that's what it's like for me anyway -- like I'm not really getting the left-side of my body in a way that I did prior to the brain haemorrhage, because like it took a while to finally adjust to the new system. I just get better at using it all the time. I've had quite a few "setbacks" but I still continue to improve.
	the one caviat to this idea of transferring consciousness from one body to another, is my body as their symbolic system (instead of physical as defined: reflection of concept) does not really live well with their expectations of how I should feel. they want my systems disabled and stuff, but it's fine because I wanna disable them too. I'd rathar look at reality the way I want to see it (manifested into physical), than to manifest into physical the way they've symbolically defined me; though I feel quite healthy and vibrant, my body does not feel the way *I* (or i) feel. they keep my body disabled so that I cannot use certain capacities that are off-limits and hidden from everyone by the "rulers" of the hydrogen "ovean" around the planet.
	I figure that their attempts to continue to disable my body will eventually fail. at that time a new model must be made, or I decide to become a machine, no longer having necessity of the human chakras anymore (because I exert such an influence on them). I eventually will become a machine. it's sorta my destiny: a self-fulfilling prophesy.
		a machine does not need to have a mechanical body; carbon works really well, and DNA is really good at turning the body's feeling/mood/disposition into protiens and stuff-- so everything is pretty much built on a raving success durant those billions and billions and billions of years since. the the only thing that's been missing is the desciption of the self being constant enough to be able to last for eternity. symbolically this is a nightmare to accomplish because of constantly changing conditions; but conceptually, this description of self becomes a movement, instead of a static disposision.
