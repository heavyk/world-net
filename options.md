### 2024-01-31 00:52 - avoiding death

so here's the thing: if I'm around a lot of dudes when I'm also around solar girls, she (the sun), is going to start to like you, which eaaentially means certain death for any emitter types that are around me (and associate me with them).
you know, this was foretold in one of shakespere's plays (I think LLL) and it basically that dudes will go out with a bang, or something (can't remember)
